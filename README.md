# Vacation Advisor Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot that I created as a school project. Since the prompt was relatively open-ended, I thought it would be a good idea to upload it a repo.

I am aware that there is an API key in the commit history but it has been removed and replaced.

## How to use
Clone the repo, then go into the folder and `pip install requirements.txt`.

Run VacationBot.py and interact with the chatbot. Note that the chatbot cannot handle punctuation and can only parse a handful of sentence templates.
